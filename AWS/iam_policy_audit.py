üîë What this script does:
Loops through all IAM users.
For each, fetches attached managed policies.
Downloads the default version of each policy.
Audits it for "Action": "*" or "s3:*" style wildcards.
Prints clear results.

üîç Walkthrough of the script line by line
import boto3

This imports the AWS SDK for Python (boto3).
Without this, you can‚Äôt talk to AWS.

def audit_policy_document(document):

This is a function that checks one policy document.
Think of it as a ‚Äúpolicy scanner.‚Äù

    statements = document.get("Statement", [])
    if isinstance(statements, dict):
        statements = [statements]

A policy has one or more "Statement" blocks.
Sometimes AWS returns a single block (a dict), sometimes a list.
This code makes sure it‚Äôs always a list, so we can loop without errors.

    for statement in statements:
        actions = statement.get("Action", [])
        if isinstance(actions, str):
            actions = [actions]


Each statement has actions.
Same trick: sometimes it‚Äôs "s3:*", sometimes it‚Äôs ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"].
We normalize it so it‚Äôs always a list.

        for action in actions:
            if action == "*" or action.endswith(":*"):
                findings.append(action)


Loop through all actions.
If action is "*" (everything) or ends with :* (like "s3:*") ‚Üí mark it as risky.
findings = list of bad actions found.

def audit_user_policies(iam_client, user_name):
    attached_policies = iam_client.list_attached_user_policies(UserName=user_name)["AttachedPolicies"]


This function is for a user.
First, it asks AWS: ‚ÄúHey, what managed policies are attached to this user?‚Äù
AWS replies with a list.

            arn = policy["PolicyArn"]
            version = iam_client.get_policy(PolicyArn=arn)["Policy"]["DefaultVersionId"]
            policy_version = iam_client.get_policy_version(
                PolicyArn=arn,
                VersionId=version
            )["PolicyVersion"]["Document"]


Each policy has an ARN (unique ID).
Policies have versions; we grab the default version.
Then we fetch the actual JSON policy document to inspect it.

            findings = audit_policy_document(policy_version)


Now we pass that JSON into our earlier ‚Äúscanner function.‚Äù
If it finds wildcards, it returns them.

def main():
    iam = boto3.client("iam")
    users = iam.list_users()["Users"]


iam = boto3.client("iam") ‚Üí creates a connection to IAM.

list_users() ‚Üí asks AWS: ‚ÄúWho are all the users in this account?‚Äù

    for user in users:
        user_name = user["UserName"]
        audit_user_policies(iam, user_name)


For each user in that list, we run our audit function.
So it checks every single IAM user automatically.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


This is just Python‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúrun main() if this file is executed.‚Äù

‚úÖ So, line by line:

main() ‚Üí list users.
audit_user_policies() ‚Üí grab their managed policies.
audit_policy_document() ‚Üí check inside each policy for wildcards.
